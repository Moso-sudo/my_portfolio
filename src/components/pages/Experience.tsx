        "Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a deep understanding of blockchain technology and its real-world use cases, including dApps, DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs. I enjoy writing smart contracts across various ecosystems such as Ethereum, StarkNet, NEAR Protocol, Cartesi (an optimistic rollup Layer 2), and Lisk.Iâ€™ve contributed to existing blockchain projects and earned bounties for my workâ€”proof that I donâ€™t just study the tech, I apply it. Simply put, I love writing smart contracts and pushing the limits of whatâ€™s possible in decentralized systems.Iâ€™m also passionate about sharing knowledge and would love to become a StarkNet smart contract tutor or instructor. I graduated from StarkNet Basecamp III, earning a shiny SPOK ðŸŽ‰, and Iâ€™m also certified as a Smart Contract Developer by the NEAR Blockchain, Lisk Ecosystem(a layer II scalling solution for ethereum). ðŸ¥³",

        "I have one year of hands-on experience with Rust, and it's quickly become one of my favorite languagesâ€”especially for building reliable, high-performance blockchain-based applications.In that time, Iâ€™ve worked with several powerful Rust frameworks and libraries, including:Actix Web â€“ a fast, lightweight web framework ideal for building scalable APIs and web services,Askama â€“ a type-safe templating engine for rendering dynamic content,Diesel â€“ a robust ORM that Iâ€™ve used extensively to interact with PostgreSQL databases.What draws me to Rust is its unique balance of speed, safety, and control. Unlike garbage-collected languages, Rust empowers developers to manage memory manuallyâ€”but in a safe and predictable way. This results in fewer runtime errors and highly optimized performance, which is critical in blockchain environments where both security and efficiency are non-negotiable.Rust's strong type system, fearless concurrency, and low-level control make it an excellent choice for developing secure, scalable, and robust decentralized systems.",
